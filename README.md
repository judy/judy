# Hey, I'm Clinton 👋

Senior engineer at **Retail Zipline**, where I build AI-powered tools for frontline retail teams.

I wrote **Zippy** — a production RAG chatbot that's been running for 2.5+ years, built on Rails, pgvector, and OpenAI. It ingests thousands of documents, decomposes them into atomic facts, and retrieves answers scoped by role and permissions. It's one of Zipline's flagship features.

Before the AI era, I spent 15+ years building web applications in Ruby on Rails — from precision agriculture to event ticketing to weather infrastructure. I've done SRE, DevOps, full-stack product work, and a fair amount of yelling at CSS.

### What I'm into

- 🤖 **AI in production** — RAG, tool calling, embeddings, the messy reality of shipping ML features
- 💎 **Ruby & Rails** — my home turf since ~2009
- 🎵 **Music production** — I make electronic music as [JUDYIO](https://weeklybeats.com/judy) and try to release a song every week
- 🛠️ **Building things** — whether it's software, developer tools, or a [hackerspace](http://www.makespace.io)

### Some things I've built

- **[Zippy](https://www.retailzipline.com)** — Production RAG chatbot with atomic fact extraction, pgvector search, tool calling, and streaming responses

- **[Artful.ly](https://github.com/fracturedatlas/artfully_app)** — Open-source event ticketing and CRM (Rails engine)
